## Installation
From your Hugo site's root, you need to initialize your site as a Hugo module.

```bash
# hugo mod init
```bash

Next creae a directory and add the latest realease of Origin to your site's module configuration

```bash
# hugo mkdir themes/bugo-theme-origin
# hugo mod get github.com/bugoio/bugo-theme-origin
```

Head over to your Hugo config file and add the module. Shown in yaml.

```yaml
module:
  imports:
  - disable: false
    ignoreConfig: false
    path: github.com/bugoio/bugo-theme-origin //repository
  - path: bugo-theme-origin                   //stored in themes/
```

That should do it.
