## Installation
Origin is meant to be used with Forestry.io and Bugo Site, which has Origin installed. You can install it on your site, but you'll need to add some parameters to your config file and some data files in `/Data`. You can save a lot of time by using Bugo Site. Instructions are provided if you need to reinstall from a Bugo Site project.

From your Hugo site's root, you need to initialize your site as a Hugo module.

```bash
# hugo mod init
```bash

Next create a directory and add the latest realease of Origin to your site's module configuration

```bash
# hugo mkdir themes/bugo-theme-origin
# hugo mod get github.com/bugoio/bugo-theme-origin
```

Head over to your Hugo config file and add the module. Shown in yaml.

```yaml
module:
  imports:
  - disable: false
    ignoreConfig: false
    path: github.com/bugoio/bugo-theme-origin //repository
  - path: bugo-theme-origin                   //stored in /themes/
```

That should do it.
