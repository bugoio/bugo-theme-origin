# Bugo Grid

Bugo's grid system is based on CSS grid. It makes heavy use of the `grid-template-areas` property.
This makes it easier to control the layouts by the block's name.

Each of the SASS files here have a set of area and column variables. 
Edit these variables to adjust your layouts.
You should be able to achieve a great deal of layouts from this system.
